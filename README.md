# Acarsserv

stupid commit
acarsserv is a companion program for [acarsdec](https://github.com/TLeconte/acarsdec) and [vdlm2dec](https://github.com/TLeconte/vdlm2dec).
It listens to acars messages on UDP coming from one or more acarsdec or vdlm2dec processes and stores them in a sqlite database.

## Compilation

To compile it, just type : 
> make -f Makefile

acarsserv need sqlite3 dev libraries (on Fedora : sqlite-devel rpm, on Ubuntu : libsqlite3-dev ).

## Examples

json format 

> acarsdec -A -o0 -j 192.168.1.1:5555 -r 0 131.525 131.725 131.825

or

> vdlm2dec -q -j 192.168.1.1:5555  -r 0 131.525 131.725 131.825

and

> acarsserv -j 192.168.1.1:5555

Old binary format :

> acarsdec -A -N 192.168.1.1:5555 -o0 -r 0 131.525 131.725 131.825

and

> acarsserv -N 192.168.1.1:5555

where 192.168.1.1 is the ip address of your computer running acarsserv.

acarsserv will create by default an acarsserv.sqb database file where it will store received messages.
You could read its content with sqlite3 command (or more sophisticated graphical interfaces like sqlitebrowser).

acarsserv has some messages filtering and network options (UTSL).
